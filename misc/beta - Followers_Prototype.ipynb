The headers are:\n","- `Ratelimit-Limit` — The rate at which points are added to your bucket. This is the average number of requests per minute you can make over an extended period of time.\n","- `Ratelimit-Remaining` — The number of points you have left to use.\n","- `Ratelimit-Reset` — A Unix epoch timestamp of when your bucket is reset to full.\n","<br><br>Individual endpoints may have additional rate limits, with additional headers to describe those limits. For details, see the documentation for each endpoint.<br><br>\n","Individual endpoints are given a point value. When an endpoint is called, the point value of the endpoint is subtracted from the total points granted to your client ID. The default point value is 1; i.e., a point is equivalent to a request. (All New Twitch API endpoints have the default point value. In the future, if an endpoint has a higher point value, that will be covered in the reference documentation for the endpoint.)<br><br>\n","If you need a higher rate limit, please fill out the form at https://dev.twitch.tv/limit-increase."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"IGB7s-8pArmY","colab_type":"code","outputId":"8658d6d2-94bf-4263-85b9-07590ce25ea8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1581959859251,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":760,"user":{"displayName":"Paul Jamison","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCrJOm08PBdW-uUqd9m2mIPqsiwsTmb-ZdnZstC=s64","userId":"11683581228407086844"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":392}},"source":["# Demo: Rate limiting & token buckets\n","\n","# We can see how much of our alotted bucket we have used by examining\n","#  the headers returned by the HTTP server's response to our request\n","\n","response = requests.get('https://api.twitch.tv/helix/users', \n","                 params  = {'login': 'stroopc'}, \n","                 headers = {'Client-ID': CLIENT_ID}\n","                 )\n","\n","# This is the full header returned from Twitch -- Note the `ratelimit` related fields\n","dict(response.headers)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'Connection': 'keep-alive',\n"," 'Content-Length': '460',\n"," 'Date': 'Mon, 17 Feb 2020 17:17:39 GMT',\n"," 'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=300',\n"," 'Vary': 'Accept-Encoding',\n"," 'X-Cache': 'MISS, MISS',\n"," 'X-Cache-Hits': '0, 0',\n"," 'X-Served-By': 'cache-sea4464-SEA, cache-hkg17929-HKG',\n"," 'X-Timer': 'S1581959860.784563,VS0,VS0,VE151',\n"," 'access-control-allow-origin': '*',\n"," 'cache-control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private',\n"," 'content-type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',\n"," 'expires': '0',\n"," 'pragma': 'no-cache',\n"," 'ratelimit-limit': '30',\n"," 'ratelimit-remaining': '29',\n"," 'ratelimit-reset': '1581959861',\n"," 'server': 'envoy',\n"," 'timing-allow-origin': 'https://www.twitch.tv',\n"," 'twitch-trace-id': '7b18aa21f63dae104cc0643aee4ec9bf',\n"," 'x-ctxlog-logid': '1-5e4acab3-0272e08f938dab8443afd569'}"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","outputId":"9c7319af-9816-42d7-b66c-d50e80436abc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1581959863864,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":842,"user":{"displayName":"Paul Jamison","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCrJOm08PBdW-uUqd9m2mIPqsiwsTmb-ZdnZstC=s64","userId":"11683581228407086844"}},"id":"7s1XryzRMAAi","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":160}},"source":["# Demo: Rate limiting & token buckets with back-to-back requests\n","def rate_lims():\n","  response = requests.get('https://api.twitch.tv/helix/users', \n","                  params  = {'login': 'stroopc'}, \n","                  headers = {'Client-ID': CLIENT_ID}\n","                  )\n","  return dict(response.headers)\n","\n","# Query Twitch API twice, back-to-back to examine effect on ratelimit\n","runs = [rate_lims(), rate_lims()]\n","ratez = ['ratelimit-limit', 'ratelimit-remaining', 'ratelimit-reset']\n","\n","# Display Results\n","for num in range(len(runs)):\n","  print(\"Run {}:\".format(num+1))\n","  for rate in ratez:\n","    print(\"   {}: {}\".format(rate, runs[num][rate]))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Run 1:\n","   ratelimit-limit: 30\n","   ratelimit-remaining: 29\n","   ratelimit-reset: 1581959866\n","Run 2:\n","   ratelimit-limit: 30\n","   ratelimit-remaining: 28\n","   ratelimit-reset: 1581959868\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Vz3SgJZ3zd1x","colab_type":"text"},"source":["___\n","# II.)

They also exist to serve as \"reminders\" of things that have been encountered when browsing documentation.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"DKqDnnMG0DSk"},"source":["### `get_chatters('username')` -- Fetch the live state of chatters in a channel \n","- This function gets the current live state chatters in a broadcaster's room (sometimes referred to as a \"channel\") on twitch.\n","- This function does not necessarily indicate whether the supplied channel is currently live.  \n"," - That is, a broadcaster can be in their own chat room without necessarily being live (for example, they may be modifying bot commands).\n"," - Thus, the function is appropriately named `get_chatters`\n","\n","- Note that no credentials were required to obtain the state of a room (no client id or auth key is used).\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UuY_2UfQ0NO4","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Fetch a list of live chatters in a supplied username's channel, returned here in json format\n","def get_chatters(username: str) -> dict:\n","  base_url = \"https://tmi.twitch.tv/group/user/\" + username.lower() + \"/chatters\"\n","  return requests.get(base_url).json()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"nKQ1jvh90SKK","colab_type":"code","outputId":"7ec8d498-e797-4783-e701-9ca192366212","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1581743856780,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":87546,"user":{"displayName":"Paul Jamison","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCrJOm08PBdW-uUqd9m2mIPqsiwsTmb-ZdnZstC=s64","userId":"11683581228407086844"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["# Demo of `get_chatters()` - a json string is returned (and formatted)\n","demo = json.dumps(get_chatters('xypherorion'), indent = 4, sort_keys=True)\n","print(demo)\n","\n","# Pandas can easily transform json format into a DataFrame:\n","pd.DataFrame(get_chatters('xypherorion'))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["{\n","    \"_links\": {},\n","    \"chatter_count\": 3,\n","    \"chatters\": {\n","        \"admins\": [],\n","        \"broadcaster\": [],\n","        \"global_mods\": [],\n","        \"moderators\": [\n","            \"nightbot\"\n","        ],\n","        \"staff\": [],\n","        \"viewers\": [\n","            \"alfredjudokus100289\",\n","            \"lexibug\"\n","        ],\n","        \"vips\": []\n","    }\n","}\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>_links</th>\n","      <th>chatter_count</th>\n","      <th>chatters</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>broadcaster</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>[]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>vips</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>[]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>moderators</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>[nightbot]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>staff</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>[]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>admins</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>[]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>global_mods</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>[]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>viewers</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>[alfredjudokus100289, lexibug]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["             _links  chatter_count                        chatters\n","broadcaster     NaN              3                              []\n","vips            NaN              3                              []\n","moderators      NaN              3                      [nightbot]\n","staff           NaN              3                              []\n","admins          NaN              3                              []\n","global_mods     NaN              3                              []\n","viewers         NaN              3  [alfredjudokus100289, lexibug]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":23}]}]}
