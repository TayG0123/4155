The headers are:\n","- `Ratelimit-Limit` — The rate at which points are added to your bucket. This is the average number of requests per minute you can make over an extended period of time.\n","- `Ratelimit-Remaining` — The number of points you have left to use.\n","- `Ratelimit-Reset` — A Unix epoch timestamp of when your bucket is reset to full.\n","<br><br>Individual endpoints may have additional rate limits, with additional headers to describe those limits. For details, see the documentation for each endpoint.<br><br>\n","Individual endpoints are given a point value. When an endpoint is called, the point value of the endpoint is subtracted from the total points granted to your client ID. The default point value is 1; i.e., a point is equivalent to a request.
